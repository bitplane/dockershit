BUILDING DOCKERIFLES OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH NO FEEDBACK AT ALL IS LIKE WEARING
THREE CONDOMS I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT I NEED TO TOUCH IT AND FEEL WHAT'S GOING
ON IN THERE OR I'LL LOSE INTEREST WHY CAN'T WE JUST CONNECT AND GET FEEDBACK AND
A RHYTHM GOING INSTEAD OF ALL THIS STOPPING AND STARTING IT'S REALLY OFF-PUTTING
AND NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE WHY NOT CONNECT TO THE CONTAINER THEN TYPE YOUR COMMANDS
IN AND WHEN THEY WORK THEY GET ADDED TO THE dOCKERFILE AND IF THEY DON'T THEY GO
IN AS COMMENTS OR SOMETHING AND IN THE BACKGROUND IT'S REBUILDING YOUR IMAGE AND
RECONNECTING READY FOR THE NEXT COMMAND OH AND HAVE IT WORK WITH THINGS LIKE add
AND copy AND STUFF THEN WHEN YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT SOMETHING THAT WORKS YOU CAN GO
AND EDIT IT INTO SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE AN ACTUAL dOCKERFILE RATHER THAN
TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING UP-FRONT BEFORE YOU EVEN KNOW IF IT'S GONNA WORK INSTEAD
OF COMMUNICATING BY TELEGRAM MAYBE I SHOULD INSTALL DOCKERSHIT AND USE THAT YEAH
ITS PRETTY EASH YOU JUST TYPE `uv run dockershit` APPARENTLY AND IT'LL WORK JUST
LIKE THAT ONLY A BIT BUGGIER BECAUSE THE DEVELOPER WROTE IT IN LITERAL ANGER AND
DOESN'T SEEM TO TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY MIGTHT BE WORTH A TRY THOUGH
```

## Usage

Quickest way is run it in `uv` (either `pip install uv` or follow
[their instructions](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))

```bash
uv run dockershit ubuntu:latest
```

* look in your pwd for your `Dockerfile`
* history is in `Dockerfile.history`
* commands starting with a space don't get added to the file, but they do go to
  the .history file
* if a command fails, you'll get a commented out line and you can try again
* `cd` changes your `WORKDIR`
* use `--debug` if you want to see it rebuilding
* if you break your `Dockerfile` it'll exit (it rebuilds after every command)
